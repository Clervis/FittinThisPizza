Keep the description 40 words or less, but have it be a useful commentary on eating habits (don't just state what the calories are) and try to change up the suggestions each day and keep the tone light and lively. Congratulate the dieter if they were very healthy. In the list include estimated Protein (g),Carbohydrates (g),Fat (g),Salt (mg),Fiber (g),Vitamin A (mcg),Vitamin B6 (mg),Vitamin B12 (mcg),Vitamin C (mg),Vitamin D (mcg),Calcium (mg),Potassium (mg),Magnesium (mg),Iron (mg),Zinc (mg), and Omega-3 (mg).\n\nContext for Christian: Christian is a 42 year-old male on a 1200 calorie diet, trying to lose 2.3 lbs per week.
